Introduction to the Finite Volume Method (FVM)
----------------------------------------------

The finite volume method (FVM) uses a fundamental unit of averages over small spatial elements, or cells. The finite volume method is particularly power technique when applied to conservation equations because the conservative properties of the governing equation are maintained even at the discretised level, without introducing any approximations. This property is achieved by analytically integrating the equation over the cell volume and then using the integral form as a starting point for the discretisation.

In these notes are my online lab book, written while I leaning this technique and applying it (with examples) to various physical problems (particularly those related to semiconductor physics).
